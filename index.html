              <h2>History</h2>
              <p>Travelling back to Luthadel, he begins to assemble a thieving crew to put his plan into motion. His best friend, Dockson, helps him follow up on Marsh's reports of a skaa with known Allomantic powers. Kelsier locates this skaa, whose name was Vin. After testing her ability to burn multiple metals, Kelsier concludes that Vin was in fact a Mistborn. She agrees to join the crew in exchange for Kelsier's training.</p>
